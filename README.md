To forecaset store item demand using time series analysis

The dataset is taken from Kaggle website and it contains 5 years (2013-2017) items and sales data from different store.
For this assignment, I have taken the data from store number one only.
From the graph, it shows seasonal graph and I have to further check for stationary by determine p-value.
By using hyperparameter, I have to find the p, d, q value with lowest AIC value.
The value is then fit to SARIMAX model to predict and forecast the store item demand for next two years.
